Executive Summary

Educate All Futures respectfully submits this proposal to the Global Education Foundation for the Youth STEM Education Grant, requesting $500,000 to expand equitable STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education access for underprivileged youth in our community. Our mission is to empower underserved youth with transformative STEM skills, equipping them for academic success and future workforce opportunities. With a proven track record of serving 1,200 students and achieving an 85% graduation rate, we now seek to scale our programs to reach an additional 500 students annually, deepen curricular offerings, and address persistent barriers to STEM participation. This grant will enable us to deliver high-impact programming, teacher training, and expanded afterschool enrichment for youth who need it most.

Needs Statement

Underprivileged youth in our community face compounded barriers to accessing quality STEM education, including under-resourced schools, lack of enrichment opportunities, and limited exposure to STEM careers. Local data reveals persistent achievement gaps; over 60% of students in our target demographic fall below grade-level proficiency in math and science. National trends mirror this disparity: students from low-income backgrounds are underrepresented in advanced STEM coursework and subsequent career pathways. This lack of access perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits social mobility.

Educate All Futures has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of targeted interventions—yet current programming is at capacity. Demand exceeds resources; waitlists for our flagship STEM Academy continue to grow each semester. Without additional funding, hundreds of bright, motivated young people will remain excluded from the skills and opportunities that shape modern economies. Equitable STEM access is not just an educational issue—it is fundamental to community development and closing opportunity gaps for generations to come.

Project Plan

With funding from the Youth STEM Education Grant, Educate All Futures will implement a multi-faceted expansion over 24 months:

1. STEM Academy Expansion: Increase enrollment by 40%, serving an additional 500 underprivileged students annually through afterschool and summer programs. The curriculum will focus on hands-on, project-based learning in coding, robotics, environmental science, and engineering.

2. Teacher Training and Support: Partner with local schools to deliver professional development workshops to 60 public school educators, equipping them with culturally responsive methods and STEM instructional tools. Ongoing coaching will ensure sustainability and amplify reach.

3. STEM Career Exploration: Launch a mentorship initiative connecting students with STEM professionals, including site visits and career panels, broadening students’ perspectives on potential futures.

4. Family Engagement: Host quarterly family STEM nights and distribute bilingual resource kits, fostering learning beyond the classroom and supporting parents as partners in their children’s growth.

All activities will be measured using robust evaluation metrics: attendance and participation rates, pre/post skill assessments, educator feedback, and participant surveys. Our goal is to raise STEM proficiency by at least 20% for program participants, increase high school STEM course enrollment, and maintain or surpass our 85% graduation rate.
